#### About

This database accompanies the chapter *Mordvin* in Uralic languages by Rueter. The goal of that study was to investigate the Moksha language with comparative reference to Erzya. Work on these materials are attributed to Rueter, Partanen, Hämäläinen & Erina, Riabov, Klement'eva, Kabaeva, Levina and others

The dataset itself is shared under CC-0, in order to allow as unproblematic reuse as possible.
